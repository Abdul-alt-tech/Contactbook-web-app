# Contactbook-web-app
A simple contact book application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to add, view, and edit contacts with profile pictures.
Project Overview

This project is a basic contact book application that allows users to add, view, and edit contacts with profile pictures. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes a RESTful API to read and write data to a server.

Features

- Add new contacts with profile pictures
- View existing contacts
- Edit contact details

Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- RESTful API (for server-side data storage and retrieval)

How it Works

The application uses a RESTful API to interact with a server, allowing users to:

- Send POST requests to add new contacts
- Send GET requests to retrieve existing contacts
- Send POST requests to edit existing contacts

The API handles the data storage and retrieval, while the client-side application provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the data.

Project Structure

The project is structured into the following directories:

- index.html: The main entry point of the application
- enter-api-key.html:
- add-contact.html: The page for adding new contacts
- edit-contact.html: The page for editing existing contacts
- config.js: The JavaScript file containing configuration variables
- CSS: The directory containing CSS stylesheets

Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser to access the application.
